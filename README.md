# 0x2a-Alhosn-Daily-Login

## **Daily sign-in based on Student ID with Al Hosn green pass:**

**Idea:**
This application will sign-in students who arrive at campus by scanning their ID Cards, while also calling the Al Hosn Green Pass Status.
This application will display the student account status to identify if the student is currently locked out of their account.

**Benefits:**
Less paper waste.
Students can seemlessly log attendance.
Students no longer need to attempt login before identifying account status.
Students can take immediate action if account status is locked.
